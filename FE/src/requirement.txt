● Build an attendance tracking system using ReactJS or VueJS, and a NodeJS (using the Fastify 
framework) backend, with a simple storage layer. The storage layer can be a simple database 
like SQLite, a JSON file, or even a NoSQL database like MongoDB (running in a Docker 
container) 

● The back-end should simply store the name, email, image of the attendee, the current 
timestamp and an indication of whether this is an ENTRY or EXIT attendance.  

● The attendee’s image should be fetched using the device’s camera interface 
● The interface should be fun and engaging. Feel free to customize it as you wish. 
● If the attendee performs LOGIN (entry) then the system should only perform LOGOUT upon 
their next encounter.  

○ Perform image match on the person on entry and exit using any other recent 
image-matching library. 

● Your solution should be implemented and runnable in a Docker container. Provide the 
Dockerfile in your repository
